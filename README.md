# Inventory & Order Management System - Backend

This is the backend for a comprehensive Inventory and Order Management System, built with a modern, high-performance tech stack including **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, and **Spring Security**.

The application provides a robust, secure, and scalable RESTful API to manage products, inventory levels, customers, and sales orders. It features JWT-based authentication and a clear, service-oriented architecture to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Secure API:** Endpoints are secured using Spring Security, with role-based access control available for future expansion.
* **Product Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products, which automatically creates an associated inventory record.
* **Inventory Tracking:** Monitor and update stock levels for each product independently via dedicated API endpoints.
* **Customer Management:** Maintain a database of customers with complete CRUD operations.
* **Order Processing:**
    * Create new sales orders with multiple line items.
    * View a list of all orders, or filter orders by salesperson or customer.
    * Drill down into detailed order information.
    * Update the status of an order (e.g., NEW, PACKED, SHIPPED).
* **User Authentication:** Secure login (`/api/login`) and registration (`/api/register`) system using JWT.
* **Decoupled Service Layer:** Business logic is separated into service interfaces and implementations for better testing and maintenance (e.g., `ProductService`, `OrderService`).
* **Notification System:** A framework for creating, retrieving, and marking notifications as read for users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the development environment running locally.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 21 or higher.
* **Gradle:** Version 8.8 or higher is recommended (the project includes a Gradle wrapper).
* **Database:** A running instance of a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Configure the Database
* Navigate to app/src/main/resources.

* Create an application.properties file.

* Add the database connection properties

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the Spring Boot application using the provided Gradle wrapper. This will handle dependency installation and run the server.

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
On Windows:
```bash
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```
## üìÇ Project Structure
The src/main/java folder is organized to maintain a clean and scalable architecture.

```text
src/main/java/org/example/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/             # Spring Security and JWT filter configurations.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller/         # REST API controllers (e.g., ProductController, OrderController).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model/              # JPA entity classes (e.g., Product, Order, User).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repository/         # Spring Data JPA repositories for database access.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service/            # Business logic interfaces and implementations.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.java            # Main Spring Boot application entry point.
```
## üîê Authentication Flow

* **Register/Login**: A new user can be created via POST /api/register. To log in, a user sends their credentials to POST /api/login.

* **Receive Token**: Upon successful login, the server generates a JWT and returns it to the client.

* **Authenticated Requests**: For all subsequent requests to protected endpoints, the client must include the JWT in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.

* **Example**: Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>

* **Authorization**: The JWTFilter intercepts each request, validates the token, and sets the user's security context, enabling access to the authorized resources.

## üìÑ API Endpoints
All endpoints are prefixed with /api. The application is configured to accept requests from http://localhost:1234.
